<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Conceptos iniciales</h1>
<p>El índice de resilencia propuesto por Briguglio. L, Cordina. G, Farrugia. N, Vella. S.(2008) esta formado por el promedio simple de cuatro componentes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Estabilidad Macroeconomica</li>
<li>Eficiiencia Microeconomica</li>
<li>Buen Gobierno</li>
<li>Desarrollo Social</li>
</ol>
<p>Para todos los componentes es necesario aplicar la siguiente fórmula de estandarización. <span class="math display">\[
  \mathrm{XE_{i,j}}=\frac{X_{ij}-MinX_{ij}}{MaxX_{ij}-MinX_{ij}}\
\]</span> Los valores estandarizados toman un rango entre 0-1.</p>
